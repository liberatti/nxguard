# NXGuard

[This project](http://nxguard.com.br) aims to create a secure and efficient environment for API exposure, essential for
organizations looking to
deliver reliable services in the digital age.

- **Efficient Reverse Proxy:** Utilizes **OpenResty** as a reverse proxy to manage incoming and outgoing API traffic,
  ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **Advanced Security:** Incorporates **ModSecurity** for detection and prevention of common threats at the application
  layer, including SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common attacks.
- **Detailed Logging:** Maintains detailed logs of all transactions, facilitating audit and event analysis for proactive
  identification of potential threats or anomalous behavior.
- **Load Balancing:** Offers load balancing capabilities to evenly distribute requests among backend servers, improving
  resilience and operational efficiency.
- **Operational Simplicity:** Uses **OpenResty** to provide a lightweight, easily configurable, and maintainable
  solution, reducing operational overhead.
- **Scalability:** The modular architecture facilitates horizontal scalability, allowing expansion as demand for
  services increases.
